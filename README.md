# Blog Generator

An automatic script to generate a statically hold HTML blog server. It can convert markdown files into a blog server.

## TO-DO's

- Add a `global.json` file to configure blog generation.
- Add a `{name}.json` file for each markdown file to allow more stylistics and options for generation.
- Add a home page for the blog (`index.html`) and an index page for each subfolder / tag (`/{tag}/index.html`)
- Automatic check and update the blog whenever the blog markdowns are updated (a file supervisor)
- Configure the `manage.py` file to allow different actions of generation (test server, etc...).
